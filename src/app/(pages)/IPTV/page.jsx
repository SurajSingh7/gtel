        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When it comes to video streaming, the terms IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) and OTT (Over the Top) often come up. While both deliver content to the end customer, they operate differently.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          IPTV refers to Internet Protocol Television, a service used to deliver video over the internet. To access IPTV, you need a broadband connection and a router, allowing you to watch TV through the internet. It's a modern way of delivering television programming.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          On the other hand, OTT (Over the Top) delivers video content on-demand without the need for a traditional cable or satellite pay-TV subscription. OTT services don’t rely on system operators for controlling or distributing content, making it an independent service with fewer restrictions.
