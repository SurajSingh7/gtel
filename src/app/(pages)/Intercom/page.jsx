          The voice industry is one of the most popular and has gone through incredible
          changes in technology in the past few years. The definition of enterprise communication
          has changed completely with the introduction of IP telephony. Magical? Yes, it is.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), also known as IP telephony, Internet telephony,
          broadband telephony, and broadband phone, allows you to take analog audio signals
          and convert them into digital data. This data is then transmitted over the Internet,
          revolutionizing the way we communicate.
